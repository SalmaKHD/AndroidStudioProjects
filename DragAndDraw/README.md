## About
This simple app creates a custom view which allows the user to draw boxes on the screen by starting at a point and dragging their finger.

It has been created using the book: [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Android-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321804333). This project has no commercial value, and it has been built for educational purposes only.

_Descriptions + Screenshots of each version of the app is included in this README._
